Cet ouvrage pratique est adapté aux spécificités françaises, organisationnelles ou techniques. Sa rédaction est axée sur deux niveaux de lecture : * un premier niveau à destination des élus décrivant les exigences des textes réglementaires et les moyens de parvenir aux objectifs fixés ; * un second niveau plus technique pour les personnes directement en charge de l'élaboration des cartes. Les questions suivantes sont abordées : * Quel est le contexte réglementaire ? Les textes officiels et notamment les textes de transposition de la directive européenne sont explicités. * Quelle organisation mettre en place ? De l'organisation administrative à l'organisation technique, quels acteurs doivent être associés à cette démarche ? * De quelles données a-t-on besoin et comment les utiliser ? Quelques expériences de cartographies d'agglomérations sont aussi présentées dans l'ouvrage.},

The feasibility of this approach will be proved implementing the system in two pilot areas with different territorial and environmental characteristics: an agglomeration and a major road. The first pilot area will be located in Milan, in a significant portion of the town, while the second one will be situated along the motorway A90 surrounding the city of Rome. The two pilot areas show peculiar needs and characteristics, such as the presence of multiple noise sources, roads junctions, traffic and weather conditions, that require a different system’s implementation approach. In this paper the main issues related to the design of the system configuration in the pilot area of Rome are described.},

Beginning with the primordial sounds of nature, we have experienced an ever-increasing complexity of our sonic surroundings. As civilization develops, new noises rise up around us: from the creaking wheel, the clang of the blacksmith’s hammer, and the distant chugging of steam trains to the “sound imperialism” of airports, city streets, and factories. The author contends that we now suffer from an overabundance of acoustic information and a proportionate diminishing of our ability to hear the nuances and subtleties of sound. Our task, he maintains, is to listen, analyze, and make distinctions.  As a society we have become more aware of the toxic wastes that can enter our bodies through the air we breathe and the water we drink. In fact, the pollution of our sonic environment is no less real. Schafer emphasizes the importance of discerning the sounds that enrich and feed us and using them to create healthier environments. To this end, he explains how to classify sounds, appreciating their beauty or ugliness, and provides exercises and “soundwalks” to help us become more discriminating and sensitive to the sounds around us. This book is a pioneering exploration of our acoustic environment, past and present, and an attempt to imagine what it might become in the future.},

Mobile sensors can be combined to classical fixed station, to improve the accuracy and the reliability of predictions. The purpose of this paper is to explore how mobile measurements should be processed to obtain reliable estimations in spite of the strong variability of the data collected. Mobile measurements have been collected on a bicycle equipped with a global positioning system (GPS), in an area of Gent (Belgium). The 1s-sound pressure levels and 1s-black carbon concentrations evolutions were measured. In addition, 5 continuous monitoring fixed stations were placed at building facades. Different processing methods are compared, based on different temporal and spatial weighting aggregations. The possibility to take profit of the fixed stations to refine estimations is tested, according to the noise levels collected at fixed stations and the distance between mobile and fixed sensors. Finally, the operational conditions required to obtain reliable estimations based on mobile measures are discussed.},

	abstract = {One of the main priorities of smart cities is improving the quality of life of their inhabitants. Traffic noise is one of the pollutant sources that causes a negative impact on the quality of life of citizens, which is gaining attention among authorities. The European Commission has promoted the Environmental Noise Directive 2002/49/EC (END) to inform citizens and to prevent the harmful effects of noise exposure. The measure of acoustic levels using noise maps is a strategic issue in the END action plan. Noise maps are typically calculated by computing the average noise during one year and updated every five years. Hence, the implementation of dynamic noise mapping systems could lead to short-term plan actions, besides helping to better understand the evolution of noise levels along time. Recently, some projects have started the monitoring of noise levels in urban areas by means of acoustic sensor networks settled in strategic locations across the city, while others have taken advantage of collaborative citizen sensing mobile applications. In this paper, we describe the design of an acoustic low-cost sensor network installed on public buses to measure the traffic noise in the city in real time. Moreover, the challenges that a ubiquitous bus acoustic measurement system entails are enumerated and discussed. Specifically, the analysis takes into account the feature extraction of the audio signal, the identification and separation of the road traffic noise from urban traffic noise, the hardware platform to measure and process the acoustic signal, the connectivity between the several nodes of the acoustic sensor network to store the data and, finally, the noise maps’ generation process. The implementation and evaluation of the proposal in a real-life scenario is left for future work.},

We express source separation as a Bayesian estimation problem and we propose efficient resolution algorithms. The resulting separation methods rely on a variable number of cues including harmonicity, spectral envelope, azimuth, note duration, and monophony. We compare these methods on two synthetic mixtures with long reverberation.

	abstract = {This paper proposes a sound event detection system for nat-ural multisource environments, using a sound source separa-tion front-end. The recognizer aims at detecting sound events from various everyday contexts. The audio is preprocessed us-ing non-negative matrix factorization and separated into four individual signals. Each sound event class is represented by a Hidden Markov Model trained using mel frequency cepstral coefficients extracted from the audio. Each separated signal is used individually for feature extraction and then segmentation and classification of sound events using the Viterbi algorithm. The separation allows detection of a maximum of four overlap-ping events. The proposed system shows a significant increase in event detection accuracy compared to a system able to output a single sequence of events.

	abstract = {The independent component analysis (ICA) of a random vector consists of searching for a linear transformation that minimizes the statistical dependence between its components. In order to define suitable search criteria, the expansion of mutual information is utilized as a function of cumulants of increasing orders. An efficient algorithm is proposed, which allows the computation of the ICA of a data matrix within a polynomial time. The concept of ICA may actually be seen as an extension of the principal component analysis (PCA), which can only impose independence up to the second order and, consequently, defines directions that are orthogonal. Potential applications of ICA include data analysis and compression, Bayesian detection, localization of sources, and blind identification and deconvolution.
Résumé
L'Analyse en Composantes Indépendentes (ICA) d'un vecteur aléatoire consiste en la recherche d'une transformation linéaire qui minimise la dépendance statistique entre ses composantes. Afin de définir des critères d'optimisation appropriés, on utilise un développment en série de l'information mutuelle en fonction de cumulants d'ordre croissant. On propose ensuite un algorithme pratique permettant le calcul de l'ICA d'une matrice de données en un temps polynomial. Le concept d'ICA peut être vu en réalité comme une extention de l'Analyse en Composantes Principales (PCA) qui, elle, ne peut imposer l'indépendence qu'au second ordre et définit par conséquent des directions orthogonales. Les applications potentielles de l'ICA incluent l'analyse et la compression de données, la détection bayesienne, la localisation de sources, et l'identification et la déconvolution aveugles.},

The key difficulty is that operating in everyday listening conditions entails processing a speech signal that is reverberantly mixed into a noise background composed of multiple competing sound sources. This paper describes a recent speech recognition evaluation that was designed to bring together researchers from multiple communities in order to foster novel approaches to this problem. The task was to identify keywords from sentences reverberantly mixed into audio backgrounds binaurally-recorded in a busy domestic environment. The challenge was designed to model the essential difficulties of multisource environment problem while remaining on a scale that would make it accessible to a wide audience. Compared to previous ASR evaluation a particular novelty of the task is that the utterances to be recognised were provided in a continuous audio background rather than as pre-segmented utterances thus allowing a range of background modelling techniques to be employed. The challenge attracted thirteen submissions. This paper describes the challenge problem, provides an overview of the systems that were entered and provides a comparison alongside both a baseline recognition system and human performance. The paper discusses insights gained from the challenge and lessons learnt for the design of future such evaluations.},

In this paper we report the construction of two additional component DBs: the Music Genre Database (100 pieces) and Musical Instrument Sound Database (50 instruments). For all 315 musical pieces, we prepared original audio signals, corresponding standard MIDI files, and text files of lyrics (for songs). For all 50 instruments, we recorded individual sounds at half-tone intervals with several variations of playing styles, dynamics, instrument manufacturers, and musicians. It is our hope that our DB will make a significant contribution to future advances in the field of music information processing.},

	abstract = {Music auto-tagging refers to automatically assigning semantic labels (tags) such as genre, mood and instrument to music so as to facilitate text-based music retrieval. Although significant progress has been made in recent years, relatively little research has focused on semantic labels that are time-varying within a track. Existing approaches and datasets usually assume that different fragments of a track share the same tag labels, disregarding the tags that are time-varying (e.g., mood) or local in time (e.g., instrument solo). In this paper, we present a new dataset dedicated to time-varying music auto-tagging. The dataset, called CAL500exp, is an enriched version of the well-known CAL500 dataset used for conventional track-level tagging. Given the tag set of CAL500, eleven subjects with strong music background were recruited to annotate the time-varying tag labels. A new user interface for annotation is developed to reduce the subject's annotation effort yet increase the quality of labels. Moreover, we present an empirical evaluation that demonstrates the performance improvement CAL500exp brings about for time-varying music auto-tagging. By providing more accurate and consistent descriptions of music content in a finer granularity, CAL500exp may open new opportunities to understand and to model the temporal context of musical semantics.},

	abstract = {A new variant ‘PMF’ of factor analysis is described. It is assumed that X is a matrix of observed data and σ is the known matrix of standard deviations of elements of X. Both X and σ are of dimensions n × m. The method solves the bilinear matrix problem X = GF + E where G is the unknown left hand factor matrix (scores) of dimensions n × p, F is the unknown right hand factor matrix (loadings) of dimensions p × m, and E is the matrix of residuals. The problem is solved in the weighted least squares sense: G and F are determined so that the Frobenius norm of E divided (element-by-element) by σ is minimized. Furthermore, the solution is constrained so that all the elements of G and F are required to be non-negative. It is shown that the solutions by PMF are usually different from any solutions produced by the customary factor analysis (FA, i.e. principal component analysis (PCA) followed by rotations). Usually PMF produces a better fit to the data than FA. Also, the result of PF is guaranteed to be non-negative, while the result of FA often cannot be rotated so that all negative entries would be eliminated. Different possible application areas of the new method are briefly discussed. In environmental data, the error estimates of data can be widely varying and non-negativity is often an essential feature of the underlying models. Thus it is concluded that PMF is better suited than FA or PCA in many environmental applications. Examples of successful applications of PMF are shown in companion papers.},

	abstract = {La transcription automatique de la musique est l'opération qui consiste, partant du seul contenu audio, à produire une représentation symbolique (par exemple un fichier MIDI) d'un morceau de musique. Si la transcription de musique monodique est aujourd'hui bien maîtrisée, le cas de la musique polyphonique est en revanche un problème largement ouvert. Les décompositions de matrices en valeurs propres et en valeurs singulières sont des techniques classiques d'algèbre linéaire utilisées dans un grand nombre d'applications de traitement du signal. Elles permettent de représenter efficacement les données observées en utilisant un nombre limité d'atomes élémentaires. Contrairement à d'autres techniques de représentations du signal, ces atomes ne sont pas recherchés au sein d'un dictionnaire pré-défini, mais sont extraits des données elles-mêmes. La factorisation en matrices non-négatives (NMF) est une technique analogue d'algèbre linéaire, qui réduit le rang tout en fournissant des atomes à valeurs exclusivement positives, plus facilement interprétables. Elle fournit conjointement un dictionnaire extrait des données et la décomposition de ces mêmes données dans ce dictionnaire. Ce mémoire est consacré à l'étude théorique et expérimentale détaillée de ces méthodes. Il poursuit plusieurs objectifs : l'amélioration des performances des systèmes de transcription qui les utilisent, de la pertinence sémantique des représentations mi-niveau produites, et du contrôle des propriétés théoriques et pratiques des algorithmes existants et originaux mis en œuvre au cours de la thèse.},

This results in a more principled approach with a solid foundation in statistical inference. More precisely, we propose to make use of a temperature controlled version of the Expectation Maximization algorithm for model fitting, which has shown excellent performance in practice. Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis has many applications, most prominently in information retrieval, natural language processing, machine learning from text, and in related areas. The paper presents perplexity results for different types of text and linguistic data collections and discusses an application in automated document indexing.

NNMA has found a wide variety of applications, including text analysis, document clustering, face/image recognition, language modeling, speech processing and many others. Despite these numerous applications, the algorithmic development for computing the NNMA factors has been relatively deficient. This paper makes algorithmic progress by modeling and solving (using multiplicative updates) new generalized NNMA problems that minimize Bregman divergences between the input matrix and its lowrank approximation. The multiplicative update formulae in the pioneering work by Lee and Seung [11] arise as a special case of our algorithms. In addition, the paper shows how to use penalty functions for incorporating constraints other than nonnegativity into the problem. Further, some interesting extensions to the use of “link ” functions for modeling nonlinear relationships are also discussed. 1},

We describe how IS-NMF is underlaid by a well-defined statistical model of superimposed gaussian components and is equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation of variance parameters. This setting can accommodate regularization constraints on the factors through Bayesian priors. In particular, inverse-gamma and gamma Markov chain priors are considered in this work. Estimation can be carried out using a space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm; this leads to a novel type of NMF algorithm, whose convergence to a stationary point of the IS cost function is guaranteed. We also discuss the links between the IS divergence and other cost functions used in NMF, in particular, the Euclidean distance and the generalized Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. As such, we describe how IS-NMF can also be performed using a gradient multiplicative algorithm (a standard algorithm structure in NMF) whose convergence is observed in practice, though not proven. Finally, we report a furnished experimental comparative study of Euclidean-NMF, KL-NMF, and IS-NMF algorithms applied to the power spectrogram of a short piano sequence recorded in real conditions, with various initializations and model orders. Then we show how IS-NMF can successfully be employed for denoising and upmix (mono to stereo conversion) of an original piece of early jazz music. These experiments indicate that IS-NMF correctly captures the semantics of audio and is better suited to the representation of music signals than NMF with the usual Euclidean and KL costs.},

The algorithm is based on factorizing the magnitude spectrogram of an input signal into a sum of components, each of which has a fixed magnitude spectrum and a time-varying gain. Each sound source, in turn, is modeled as a sum of one or more components. The parameters of the components are estimated by minimizing the reconstruction error between the input spectrogram and the model, while restricting the component spectrograms to be nonnegative and favoring components whose gains are slowly varying and sparse. Temporal continuity is favored by using a cost term which is the sum of squared differences between the gains in adjacent frames, and sparseness is favored by penalizing nonzero gains. The proposed iterative estimation algorithm is initialized with random values, and the gains and the spectra are then alternatively updated using multiplicative update rules until the values converge. Simulation experiments were carried out using generated mixtures of pitched musical instrument samples and drum sounds. The performance of the proposed method was compared with independent subspace analysis and basic nonnegative matrix factorization, which are based on the same linear model. According to these simulations, the proposed method enables a better separation quality than the previous algorithms. Especially, the temporal continuity criterion improved the detection of pitched musical sounds. The sparseness criterion did not produce significant improvements},

Also, a direct modification of NMF, the weighted non-negative matrix factorization (WNMF) has also been introduced to improve the NMF capabilities of representing positive local data (as color histograms). A comparison between NMF, WNMF and the well-known principal component analysis (PCA) in the context of image patch classification has been carried out and it is claimed that all these three techniques can be combined in a common and unique classifier. This contribution is an extension of a previous study and we introduce the use of the WNMF as well as a probabilistic approach to compare all the three techniques noticing a great improvement in the final recognition results.},

The cluster membership of each document can be easily determined by finding the base topic (the axis) with which the document has the largest projection value. Our experimental evaluations show that the proposed document clustering method surpasses the latent semantic indexing and the spectral clustering methods not only in the easy and reliable derivation of document clustering results, but also in document clustering accuracies.},

In particular, we view images as matrices and the goal of hashing as a randomized dimensionality reduction that retains the essence of the original image matrix while preventing intentional attacks of guessing and forgery. Our work is motivated by the fact that standard-rank reduction techniques, such as QR and singular value decomposition, produce low-rank bases which do not respect the structure (i.e., non-negativity for images) of the original data. We observe that NMFs have two very desirable properties for secure image hashing applications: 1) The additivity property resulting from the non-negativity constraints results in bases that capture local components of the image, thereby significantly reducing misclassification and 2) the effect of geometric attacks on images in the spatial domain manifests (approximately) as independent identically distributed noise on NMF vectors, allowing the design of detectors that are both computationally simple and, at the same time, optimal in the sense of minimizing error probabilities. Receiver operating characteristics analysis over a large image database reveals that the proposed algorithms significantly outperform existing approaches for image hashing.},

Clustering based on gene-expression data has been shown to be a powerful method in cancer class discovery. Non-negative matrix factorization is one such method and was shown to be advantageous over other clustering techniques, such as hierarchical clustering or self-organizing maps. In this paper, we investigate the benefit of explicitly enforcing sparseness in the factorization process.Results: We report an improved unsupervised method for cancer classification by the use of gene-expression profile via sparse non-negative matrix factorization. We demonstrate the improvement by direct comparison with classic non-negative matrix factorization on the three well-studied datasets. In addition, we illustrate how to identify a small subset of co-expressed genes that may be directly involved in cancer.Contact:g1m1c1@receptor.med.harvard.edu, ygao@receptor.med.harvard.eduSupplementary information:http://arep.med.harvard.edu/snmf/supplement.htm},

The EG(+/-) algorithm uses the components of the gradient in the exponents of factors that are used in updating the weight vector multiplicatively. We present worst-case loss bounds for EG(+/-) and compare them to previously known bounds for the GD algorithm. The bounds suggest that the losses of the algorithms are in general incomparable, but EG(+/-) has a much smaller loss if only a few components of the input are relevant for the predictions. We have performed experiments, which show that our worst-case upper bounds are quite tight already on simple artificial data.},

	abstract = {A system to aid composition with analysis, transformation, and re-synthesis of natural sounds is described. Sinusoidal analysis is used to isolate and extract deterministic sounds, and transients are also isolated/extracted, leaving the stochastic background which is parameterized by wavelet tree analysis. All of these components become templates for the synthesis phase, which is controlled (1) by placing templates on timelines or in groups, (2) by real-time manipulation of parameters, and (3) via scripting using the ChucK language. The result is a flexible “workbench” for doing modern day musique concrète or acousmatic composition, sound design, and other sonic sculpting tasks.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses the development of an interactive soundscape simulator, enabling users to manipulate a series of parameters to investigate if there is group correlation between factors such as source selection, positioning and level. The basis of the simulator stems from fieldwork and recordings carried out in London and Manchester. Through the use of an enhanced version of soundwalking, respondents are led on a walk around an urban space focusing on the soundscape, whilst answering questions in a semi-structured interview. The data collected is then used to inform the ecological validity of the simulator. The laboratory based tests use simulations based on spaces recorded in a series of urban locations, as well as an ‘idealised’ soundscape simulation, featuring data from all recorded locations. The sound sources used are based on user highlighted selections from all locations, based on preferences extracted from soundwalk field data. Preliminary results show the simulator is effective in obtaining numerical data based on subjective choices as well as, effective qualitative data which provides an insight into the reasoning behind the respondents choices. This work forms part of the Positive Soundscape Project.},

The two resulting median ﬁltered spectrograms are then used to generate masks which are then applied to the original spectrogram to separate the harmonic and percussive parts of the signal. We illustrate the use of the algorithm in the context of remixing audio material from commercial recordings.},

	abstract = {Dans l'organisation d'une expérimentation en blocs, lorsque le nombre de traitements étudiés excède la taille des blocs, il est classique de recourir à un plan en blocs incomplets équilibrés (B.I.E.). Lorsque ce dernier n'existe pas pour une configuration nombres de blocs/nombre de traitements/nombre de traitements par bloc donnée, l'expérimentateur peut préférer se ramener à un B.I.E. dont la configuration est « proche » de celle étudiée, pour bénéficier des propriétés statistiques remarquables de tels plans. Ce faisant, il renonce en général à des données potentiellement disponibles. À l'inverse, l'expérimentateur peut envisager de construire le plan en respectant strictement la configuration initiale afin de prendre en compte la totalité de ces données, quitte à dégrader les propriétés d'équilibre du plan. Ces deux approches sont d'abord comparées à partir de deux exemples où le plan à construire peut être obtenu de façon simple en adaptant un plan en B.I.E.; les exemples proposés montrent qu'il est préférable, en terme d'efficacité, de conserver la configuration initiale, plutôt que de se ramener à un B.I.E. Pour des configurations plus complexes, les plans peuvent être construits avec profit à partir d'un algorithme de construction de plans optimaux. Les simulations présentées pour un grand nombre de configurations montrent qu'à défaut de présenter systématiquement les équilibres remarquables d'un B.I.E., les plans optimaux ainsi obtenus possèdent une efficacité comparable à ces plans de référence.},

This package produces graphical displays of data that are simple to interpret, and it also provides syntheses of results issuing from various analysis of variance models or from various factor analysis methods accompanied with confidence ellipses. SensoMineR is a free software intended for sensory analysts from both academic and corporate institutions. SensoMineR is an easy and powerful solution that tackles the following problems: characterization of the products, panel performance assessment, links between sensory and instrumental data, consumer's preferences, napping evaluation, optimal designs. SensoMineR is implemented in R and can be used easily with the help of a very intuitive graphical interface.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we aim at better understanding how human mental representations are structured in the specific case of the perception of urban soundscapes. This task is traditionally studied using questionnaires, surveys or categorization tasks followed by a lexical analysis. In contrast, we propose a new experimental approach to tackle this aim. In this approach, the subject is asked to manipulate sound events and textures within a dedicated computer environment in order to recreate two complex urban soundscapes, one ideal and the other not ideal. Subjects have access to a sound data set which has been designed and structured based upon perceptual considerations, and may alter the physical parameters of the selected sound samples. In order to achieve this, we use an audio-digital environment and a web audio interface for sound mining developed for the purpose of this study. The latter allows subjects to explore a sound database without resorting to text. By focusing on the auditory modality during the experimental process, this new paradigm potentially allows the subject to be better put in context and provides a more detailed description of the actual mental representations. In the light of the results presented in this paper, it seems that it also reduces the potential bias of only using verbalization during the experiment.},

	url = {https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00636943},
	abstract = {Intrinsic variability due to micrometeorological effects and/or ground effects, measurement uncertainty and model uncertainty are the main sources of spreading of the parameters influencing outdoor sound propagation. Thus spreading associated to outdoor SPL is a complex combination of deterministic, stochastic and epistemic uncertainties, and can be quantified thanks to a probabilistic process. This statistical process is presented in this paper and is called Calibration Under Uncertainty (CUU). Quantitative uncertainty assessment involves a pre-existing physical system to be studied, input data which can be measured or derived from measurements, and a sufficient amount of available (experimental and/or numerical) data with an eventual human expertise. CUU couples information from experimental and modelled data taking into account their own uncertainties (measurements errors, lack of knowledge on physical behavior, etc.)under specific assumptions. Quantify the global uncertainty on SPL, rank or apportion the contributions of influent parameters to a given output quantity of interest, compare experimental and effective parameters, and more generally understand the whole input-output structure are the main tasks of such a statistical method. CUU process has been applied to more or less complex cases using a large experimental set of data (Lannemezan 2005 (F)). An application to near ground sound propagation has been first led to understand the relative influence of ground parameters. A more complex case considering large distances and including micrometeorological effects has also been fulfilled with promising results which are presented in this paper.},

    abstract = "This paper proposes an acoustic event detection (AED) method using semi-supervised non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with a mixture of local dictionaries (MLD). The proposed method based on semi-supervised NMF newly introduces a noise dictionary and a noise activation matrix both dedicated to unknown acoustic atoms which are not included in MLD. Because unknown acoustic atoms are better modeled by the new noise dictionary learned upon classification and the new activation matrix, the proposed method provides a higher classification performance for event classes modeled by MLD when a signal to be classified is contaminated by unknown acoustic atoms. Evaluation results using DCASE2016 task 2 Dataset show that F-measure by the proposed method with semisupervised NMF is improved by as much as 11.1\% compared to that by the conventional method with supervised NMF.",
