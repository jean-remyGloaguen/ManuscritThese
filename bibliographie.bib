Cet ouvrage pratique est adapté aux spécificités françaises, organisationnelles ou techniques. Sa rédaction est axée sur deux niveaux de lecture : * un premier niveau à destination des élus décrivant les exigences des textes réglementaires et les moyens de parvenir aux objectifs fixés ; * un second niveau plus technique pour les personnes directement en charge de l'élaboration des cartes. Les questions suivantes sont abordées : * Quel est le contexte réglementaire ? Les textes officiels et notamment les textes de transposition de la directive européenne sont explicités. * Quelle organisation mettre en place ? De l'organisation administrative à l'organisation technique, quels acteurs doivent être associés à cette démarche ? * De quelles données a-t-on besoin et comment les utiliser ? Quelques expériences de cartographies d'agglomérations sont aussi présentées dans l'ouvrage.},

	isbn = {978-2-11-095825-9},
	abstract = {Le précédent guide de prévision de l'émission du bruit émis par le trafic routier remonte à 1980. Le parc automobile, les revêtements routiers, les méthodes d'évaluation des émissions sonores ont évolué. Il devenait donc indispensable de produire un nouveau guide de calcul des émissions. C'est l'objet de ce document.

Le calcul des niveaux sonores ainsi obtenu est nécessaire pour ensuite prévoir les niveaux sonores à grande distance en tenant compte des effets de sol et de météorologie sur la propagation. C'est l'objet d'un autre guide ayant pour titre "Prévision du bruit routier - NMPB 2008- Méthode de calcul de propagation du bruit incluant les effets météorologiques".

Après avoir rappelé quelques définitions spécifiques à l'acoustique (définition des grandeurs physiques, de grandeurs caractéristiques du trafic, présentation des hypothèses de travail …), le guide étudie les deux composantes du bruit émis. L'émission est en effet décomposée en deux composantes : une composante due au bruit dit "de roulement", due au contact pneumatique-chaussée, et une comosante "moteur".

Le guide innove en prenant compte la catégorie du revêtement et son âge dans le calcul du bruit de "roulement".

La première partie du guide décrit la méthode (démarches, formules).
La deuxième partie présente les enjeux associés, les fondements des formules ou des valeurs utilisées, leurs limites, ainsi qu'une comparaison entre les deux guides (celui de 1980 et celui de 2008).},

	abstract = {La NMPB-Routes-2008 est la méthode française de prévision du bruit routier issue de la méthode expérimentale NMPB-Routes-1996. Elle est conçue aussi bien pour les études d'impact de projets routiers que pour la réalisation de cartes de bruit en application de la directive 2002/49/CE.

Après avoir rappelé son domaine d'application, le document présente la méthodologie suivie : il s'agit de calculer les différents termes à l'origine de l'atténuation de l'onde sonore (divergence géométrique, absorption atmosphérique, effet de sol, diffraction), dans les conditions favorables à sa propagation (effet du vent ou d'inversion de température favorisant la propagation des ondes sonores vers les habitations) ou neutre (on parle alors de condtions homogènes).

Le début de l'ouvrage rappelle la manière de décrire la source, en faisant référence au nouveau guide d'émission du bruit 2008 ("Prévision du bruit routier " Document 1 " Calcul des émissions sonores dues au trafic routier"). Il explique ensuite la manière de prendre en compte les effets de la micrométéorologie dans la prévision du bruit à long terme.
Le chapitre suivant décrit les différents types de propagation, avant d'aborder la méthodologie de calcul des rayons, en tenant compte des effets de la diffraction s'il y a lieu.

Dans les annexes figurent les occurrences météo sur 2 et 3 périodes (2 périodes pour la législation française, 3 périodes pour l'application de la directive Européenne 2002/49/CE) pour 41 villes réparties sur le territoire français. Ces occurrences météorologiques sont utilisées pour calculer le niveau sonore de long terme dans les 18 directions autour du point de mesure considéré.
Les annexes rappellent aussi les relations existant entre la météorologie et la propagation du son, avant de préciser les différentes échelles de temps à envisager pour réaliser une analyse météorologique d'une situation acoustique.
Les annexes se terminent par une comparaison entre la méthode de propagation du bruit de 1996, avec celle de 2008, avant de proposer des exemples didactiques d'application de cette nouvelle méthode.},

	abstract = {The two last decades have seen the growth of a large body of scientific and technical literature regarding the effects of anthropogenic noise on terrestrial wildlife and their mitigation. These effects range from behavioral modifications like signalling louder, increasing the signalling rate or redundancy, signalling at a higher pitch, signalling outside noisy periods, but also alterations of intraspecific or interspecific interactions. Moreover it is now proven that man-made noise may lead to reduced reproductive success, reduced species richness or reduced density. The careful design of experiments helps avoid methodological biases some more ancient studies in this field may suffer of. This paper reviews the published literature from an engineering perspective. The focus is put on recommendations for impact assessment and mitigation. The analysis carried out emphasizes that more attention paid to anthropogenic noise emission aspects, especially road surfaces, and propagation issues, in particular micro-meteorology and the range of validity of the prediction methods used, would significantly improve the guidance available.},

The transmission line matrix method, based on the Huygens’ principle, had already been validated over impedant grounds and complex topography. The presented formulation proposes to take into account meteorological effects (wind speed and temperature) through the relative sound speed. The necessary wavefront direction is determined through the calculation of the averaged intensity vector direction. A good agreement is found between simulations of both the transmission line matrix and parabolic equation methods. A relevant use of the method is shown in the framework of environmental acoustics and initial applications are proposed in Part 2.},

The method consists of two simultaneous on-site procedures in various urban situations in two French cities (main thorough fares, pedestrian precincts, playgrounds and market squares). While passers-by were required to express their opinion about soundscapes through questionnaires, we recorded samples of ambient sound environments and calculated acoustic parameters. The cross analysis between survey data and acoustic parameters indicated the sound level is appropriate to the description of main thorough fares, but for similar sound level locations (square, market, or playground) two further perceptive factors were remind. The perceptual spatial dimension was correlated with acoustic indicators as background noise or standard deviation of short LAeq, whereas the temporal dimension revealed differences in the perceptual attitudes of the survey respondents. The results obtained consequently identified the limitation of matching a unique acoustic descriptor with two cognitive representations (a global point of view versus a discrete listening) of the same acoustic phenomenon.},

	abstract = {Since the introduction of the Environmental Noise Directive, strategic noise mapping has been used as a tool for noise policy in many European countries. Although these strategic noise maps have their merits, they also have some shortcomings: accuracy in predicted noise levels in shielded or quiet areas is not very high, the maps fail to capture sounds that are less easy to predict, and above all the dynamics of the sound environment are not included. However, these dynamics might be important to evaluate sleep disturbance and noise annoyance. In this paper, a model to dynamically (every 15min) update a noise map based on measurements is proposed. This model relies on reasonable good source and propagation models and a not-very-dense measurement network. The least mean squares method (LMS) is used for tuning model parameters. To avoid an under-determined system, the number of degrees of freedom is reduced by grouping the sources and propagation paths into different categories. Source strengths and propagation path attenuations in the same category are corrected by offsetting the same small values from their base levels. The map-based interpolation is performed jointly on LAeq,L10 and L90, and takes into account 1/3-octave band spectra. The efficiency of the proposed method was validated in a case study in the Katendrecht district of Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The results showed that more than 75\% of the LAeq predictions are closer to the measurement than the ab initio calculations based on traffic data. Values for L10 and L90 are closer to measurements for 55\% and 90\% of the observations, respectively.},

	abstract = {Noise caused by industry and infrastructure is a major source of dissatisfaction with the environment in residential areas. In order to assess and monitor the influence of noise, policies on noise control have been developed in most European countries. Noise effect studies are carried out to support these policies. The result of different studies can only be combined or compared if the same indicators for noise exposure and the same assessment methods are used. It is therefore important to develop standardised methods for noise mapping. This is recognised by the DG Environment of the European Commission, who is preparing a Directive on Environmental Noise. This article illustrates and underlines the essence of standardised noise mapping tools. It also describes considerations for the development of these tools and focuses on: accuracy; cost-benefit criteria for noise measures; and presentation of uncertainties in results.

Geographical Information Systems (GIS) play an important role in noise mapping. An appropriate use of GIS in mapping noise effects makes it possible to optimise quality and efficiency of noise effect studies. Standardisation will benefit from the possibility of automating the noise mapping process in GIS. Furthermore, GIS can play an important role in estimating and exposing uncertainties.},

calculated for Lden and Lnight using the Harmonoise prediction method as recommended

The results demonstrate that using a GIS to integrate noise data with other available spatial data can enhance the accuracy and visualisation of noise maps. In this regard, 3D noise animation was undertaken with a view to increasing public awareness in relation to environmental road transport noise. The results suggest that GIS based noise mapping has the potential to be more effective at
informing environmental policy decision-making, particularly in terms of the actions to be taken as a result of excessively high environmental noise levels. The research also
demonstrates that noise maps are visually sensitive to different methods of data
interpolation. This is something which has not been explored to any great extent in

Residential exposure is determined for L(den) and L(night) while worker exposure is determined for L(den). In order to analyse the potential of traffic management as a noise abatement measure, traffic was redirected from the main residential areas to alternative road links and the revised exposure levels were determined. The results show that the extent of noise exposure in Dublin is considerable, and in relative terms, it is worse for the night-time period. In addition, the results suggest also that traffic management measures have the potential to lead to significant reductions in the level of noise exposure provided that careful consideration is given to the impact of traffic flows on residential populations.},

In total this included one agglomeration, one airport and approximately 600 km of major roads outside the agglomeration. These noise maps describe the level of noise exposure of approximately 1.25 million people. The first phase of noise mapping was dealt with by five noise mapping bodies while 26 action planning authorities were involved in the development of the associated action plans. The second phase of noise mapping, due to be completed in 2012, sees a reduction in the defined thresholds describing the required agglomerations, roads and railways that have to be mapped. This will have a significant impact on the extent of mapping required. In Ireland this will result in an increased number of local authorities being required to develop strategic noise maps for their area along with the further development of associated action plans. It is appropriate at this point to review the work process and results from the first phase of noise mapping in Ireland in order to establish areas that could be improved, throughout the noise mapping project. In this paper a review of the implementation procedures focussing on (dominant) road traffic noise is presented. It is identified that more standardisation is needed and this could be achieved by the establishment of a national expert steering group.},

However, in some situations, the visual information is not sufficient or sufficiently reliable, whereas the use of microphones and audio event detectors can significantly improve the overall reliability of surveillance systems. In this paper, we propose a novel method for detecting road accidents by analyzing audio streams to identify hazardous situations such as tire skidding and car crashes. Our method is based on a two-layer representation of an audio stream: at a low level, the system extracts a set of features that is able to capture the discriminant properties of the events of interest, and at a high level, a representation based on a bag-of-words approach is then exploited in order to detect both short and sustained events. The deployment architecture for using the system in real environments is discussed, together with an experimental analysis carried out on a data set made publicly available for benchmarking purposes. The obtained results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

The feasibility of this approach will be proved implementing the system in two pilot areas with different territorial and environmental characteristics: an agglomeration and a major road. The first pilot area will be located in Milan, in a significant portion of the town, while the second one will be situated along the motorway A90 surrounding the city of Rome. The two pilot areas show peculiar needs and characteristics, such as the presence of multiple noise sources, roads junctions, traffic and weather conditions, that require a different system’s implementation approach.

Beginning with the primordial sounds of nature, we have experienced an ever-increasing complexity of our sonic surroundings. As civilization develops, new noises rise up around us: from the creaking wheel, the clang of the blacksmith’s hammer, and the distant chugging of steam trains to the “sound imperialism” of airports, city streets, and factories. The author contends that we now suffer from an overabundance of acoustic information and a proportionate diminishing of our ability to hear the nuances and subtleties of sound. Our task, he maintains, is to listen, analyze, and make distinctions.  As a society we have become more aware of the toxic wastes that can enter our bodies through the air we breathe and the water we drink. In fact, the pollution of our sonic environment is no less real. Schafer emphasizes the importance of discerning the sounds that enrich and feed us and using them to create healthier environments. To this end, he explains how to classify sounds, appreciating their beauty or ugliness, and provides exercises and “soundwalks” to help us become more discriminating and sensitive to the sounds around us. This book is a pioneering exploration of our acoustic environment, past and present, and an attempt to imagine what it might become in the future.},

Mobile sensors can be combined to classical fixed station, to improve the accuracy and the reliability of predictions. The purpose of this paper is to explore how mobile measurements should be processed to obtain reliable estimations in spite of the strong variability of the data collected. Mobile measurements have been collected on a bicycle equipped with a global positioning system (GPS), in an area of Gent (Belgium). The 1s-sound pressure levels and 1s-black carbon concentrations evolutions were measured. In addition, 5 continuous monitoring fixed stations were placed at building facades. Different processing methods are compared, based on different temporal and spatial weighting aggregations. The possibility to take profit of the fixed stations to refine estimations is tested, according to the noise levels collected at fixed stations and the distance between mobile and fixed sensors. Finally, the operational conditions required to obtain reliable estimations based on mobile measures are discussed.},

	abstract = {One of the main priorities of smart cities is improving the quality of life of their inhabitants. Traffic noise is one of the pollutant sources that causes a negative impact on the quality of life of citizens, which is gaining attention among authorities. The European Commission has promoted the Environmental Noise Directive 2002/49/EC (END) to inform citizens and to prevent the harmful effects of noise exposure. The measure of acoustic levels using noise maps is a strategic issue in the END action plan. Noise maps are typically calculated by computing the average noise during one year and updated every five years. Hence, the implementation of dynamic noise mapping systems could lead to short-term plan actions, besides helping to better understand the evolution of noise levels along time. Recently, some projects have started the monitoring of noise levels in urban areas by means of acoustic sensor networks settled in strategic locations across the city, while others have taken advantage of collaborative citizen sensing mobile applications. In this paper, we describe the design of an acoustic low-cost sensor network installed on public buses to measure the traffic noise in the city in real time. Moreover, the challenges that a ubiquitous bus acoustic measurement system entails are enumerated and discussed. Specifically, the analysis takes into account the feature extraction of the audio signal, the identification and separation of the road traffic noise from urban traffic noise, the hardware platform to measure and process the acoustic signal, the connectivity between the several nodes of the acoustic sensor network to store the data and, finally, the noise maps’ generation process. The implementation and evaluation of the proposal in a real-life scenario is left for future work.},

In order to define suitable search criteria, the expansion of mutual information is utilized as a function of cumulants of increasing orders. An efficient algorithm is proposed, which allows the computation of the ICA of a data matrix within a polynomial time. The concept of ICA may actually be seen as an extension of the principal component analysis (PCA), which can only impose independence up to the second order and, consequently, defines directions that are orthogonal. Potential applications of ICA include data analysis and compression, Bayesian detection, localization of sources, and blind identification and deconvolution.
Résumé
L'Analyse en Composantes Indépendentes (ICA) d'un vecteur aléatoire consiste en la recherche d'une transformation linéaire qui minimise la dépendance statistique entre ses composantes. Afin de définir des critères d'optimisation appropriés, on utilise un développment en série de l'information mutuelle en fonction de cumulants d'ordre croissant. On propose ensuite un algorithme pratique permettant le calcul de l'ICA d'une matrice de données en un temps polynomial. Le concept d'ICA peut être vu en réalité comme une extention de l'Analyse en Composantes Principales (PCA) qui, elle, ne peut imposer l'indépendence qu'au second ordre et définit par conséquent des directions orthogonales. Les applications potentielles de l'ICA incluent l'analyse et la compression de données, la détection bayesienne, la localisation de sources, et l'identification et la déconvolution aveugles.},

The key difficulty is that operating in everyday listening conditions entails processing a speech signal that is reverberantly mixed into a noise background composed of multiple competing sound sources. This paper describes a recent speech recognition evaluation that was designed to bring together researchers from multiple communities in order to foster novel approaches to this problem. The task was to identify keywords from sentences reverberantly mixed into audio backgrounds binaurally-recorded in a busy domestic environment. The challenge was designed to model the essential difficulties of multisource environment problem while remaining on a scale that would make it accessible to a wide audience. Compared to previous ASR evaluation a particular novelty of the task is that the utterances to be recognised were provided in a continuous audio background rather than as pre-segmented utterances thus allowing a range of background modelling techniques to be employed. The challenge attracted thirteen submissions. This paper describes the challenge problem, provides an overview of the systems that were entered and provides a comparison alongside both a baseline recognition system and human performance. The paper discusses insights gained from the challenge and lessons learnt for the design of future such evaluations.},

Shared DBs are common in other research fields and have made significant contributions to progress in those fields. The field of music information processing, however, has lacked a common DB of musical pieces or a large-scale DB of musical instrument sounds. We therefore recently constructed the RWC Music Database comprising four original component DBs: the Popular Music Database (100 pieces), Royalty-Free Music Database (15 pieces), Classical Music Database (50 pieces), and Jazz Music Database (50 pieces). In this paper we report the construction of two additional component DBs: the Music Genre Database (100 pieces) and Musical Instrument Sound Database (50 instruments). For all 315 musical pieces, we prepared original audio signals, corresponding standard MIDI files, and text files of lyrics (for songs). For all 50 instruments, we recorded individual sounds at half-tone intervals with several variations of playing styles, dynamics, instrument manufacturers, and musicians. It is our hope that our DB will make a significant contribution to future advances in the field of music information processing.},

	abstract = {Music auto-tagging refers to automatically assigning semantic labels (tags) such as genre, mood and instrument to music so as to facilitate text-based music retrieval. Although significant progress has been made in recent years, relatively little research has focused on semantic labels that are time-varying within a track. Existing approaches and datasets usually assume that different fragments of a track share the same tag labels, disregarding the tags that are time-varying (e.g., mood) or local in time (e.g., instrument solo). In this paper, we present a new dataset dedicated to time-varying music auto-tagging. The dataset, called CAL500exp, is an enriched version of the well-known CAL500 dataset used for conventional track-level tagging. Given the tag set of CAL500, eleven subjects with strong music background were recruited to annotate the time-varying tag labels. A new user interface for annotation is developed to reduce the subject's annotation effort yet increase the quality of labels. Moreover, we present an empirical evaluation that demonstrates the performance improvement CAL500exp brings about for time-varying music auto-tagging. By providing more accurate and consistent descriptions of music content in a finer granularity, CAL500exp may open new opportunities to understand and to model the temporal context of musical semantics.},

	abstract = {A new variant ‘PMF’ of factor analysis is described. It is assumed that X is a matrix of observed data and σ is the known matrix of standard deviations of elements of X. Both X and σ are of dimensions n × m. The method solves the bilinear matrix problem X = GF + E where G is the unknown left hand factor matrix (scores) of dimensions n × p, F is the unknown right hand factor matrix (loadings) of dimensions p × m, and E is the matrix of residuals. The problem is solved in the weighted least squares sense: G and F are determined so that the Frobenius norm of E divided (element-by-element) by σ is minimized. Furthermore, the solution is constrained so that all the elements of G and F are required to be non-negative. It is shown that the solutions by PMF are usually different from any solutions produced by the customary factor analysis (FA, i.e. principal component analysis (PCA) followed by rotations). Usually PMF produces a better fit to the data than FA. Also, the result of PF is guaranteed to be non-negative, while the result of FA often cannot be rotated so that all negative entries would be eliminated. Different possible application areas of the new method are briefly discussed. In environmental data, the error estimates of data can be widely varying and non-negativity is often an essential feature of the underlying models. Thus it is concluded that PMF is better suited than FA or PCA in many environmental applications. Examples of successful applications of PMF are shown in companion papers.},

Si la transcription de musique monodique est aujourd'hui bien maîtrisée, le cas de la musique polyphonique est en revanche un problème largement ouvert. Les décompositions de matrices en valeurs propres et en valeurs singulières sont des techniques classiques d'algèbre linéaire utilisées dans un grand nombre d'applications de traitement du signal. Elles permettent de représenter efficacement les données observées en utilisant un nombre limité d'atomes élémentaires. Contrairement à d'autres techniques de représentations du signal, ces atomes ne sont pas recherchés au sein d'un dictionnaire pré-défini, mais sont extraits des données elles-mêmes. La factorisation en matrices non-négatives (NMF) est une technique analogue d'algèbre linéaire, qui réduit le rang tout en fournissant des atomes à valeurs exclusivement positives, plus facilement interprétables. Elle fournit conjointement un dictionnaire extrait des données et la décomposition de ces mêmes données dans ce dictionnaire. Ce mémoire est consacré à l'étude théorique et expérimentale détaillée de ces méthodes. Il poursuit plusieurs objectifs : l'amélioration des performances des systèmes de transcription qui les utilisent, de la pertinence sémantique des représentations mi-niveau produites, et du contrôle des propriétés théoriques et pratiques des algorithmes existants et originaux mis en œuvre au cours de la thèse.},

Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis has many applications, most prominently in information retrieval, natural language processing, machine learning from text, and in related areas.

NNMA has found a wide variety of applications, including text analysis, document clustering, face/image recognition, language modeling, speech processing and many others. Despite these numerous applications, the algorithmic development for computing the NNMA factors has been relatively deficient. This paper makes algorithmic progress by modeling and solving (using multiplicative updates) new generalized NNMA problems that minimize Bregman divergences between the input matrix and its lowrank approximation. The multiplicative update formulae in the pioneering work by Lee and Seung [11] arise as a special case of our algorithms. In addition, the paper shows how to use penalty functions for incorporating constraints other than nonnegativity into the problem. Further, some interesting extensions to the use of “link ” functions for modeling nonlinear relationships are also discussed. 1},

We review several approaches which allow us to obtain generalized forms of multiplicative NMF algorithms and unify some existing algorithms. We give also the flexible and relaxed form of the NMF algorithms to increase convergence speed and impose some desired constraints such as sparsity and smoothness of components. Moreover, the effects of various regularization terms and constraints are clearly shown. The scope of these results is vast since the proposed generalized divergence functions include quite large number of useful loss functions such as the squared Euclidean distance,Kulback-Leibler divergence, Itakura-Saito, Hellinger, Pearson’s chi-square, and Neyman’s chi-square distances, etc. We have applied successfully the developed algorithms to blind (or semi blind) source separation (BSS) where sources can be generally statistically dependent, however they satisfy some other conditions or additional constraints such as nonnegativity, sparsity and/or smoothness.},

In this paper, we propose a projected non-linear conjugate gradient algorithm using orthogonal searching directions at each iteration which ensures each descent direction is different from others.

	abstract = {This letter presents theoretical, algorithmic, and experimental results about nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) with the Itakura-Saito (IS) divergence. We describe how IS-NMF is underlaid by a well-defined statistical model of superimposed gaussian components and is equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation of variance parameters. This setting can accommodate regularization constraints on the factors through Bayesian priors. In particular, inverse-gamma and gamma Markov chain priors are considered in this work. Estimation can be carried out using a space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm; this leads to a novel type of NMF algorithm, whose convergence to a stationary point of the IS cost function is guaranteed. We also discuss the links between the IS divergence and other cost functions used in NMF, in particular, the Euclidean distance and the generalized Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. As such, we describe how IS-NMF can also be performed using a gradient multiplicative algorithm (a standard algorithm structure in NMF) whose convergence is observed in practice, though not proven. Finally, we report a furnished experimental comparative study of Euclidean-NMF, KL-NMF, and IS-NMF algorithms applied to the power spectrogram of a short piano sequence recorded in real conditions, with various initializations and model orders. Then we show how IS-NMF can successfully be employed for denoising and upmix (mono to stereo conversion) of an original piece of early jazz music. These experiments indicate that IS-NMF correctly captures the semantics of audio and is better suited to the representation of music signals than NMF with the usual Euclidean and KL costs.},

	abstract = {An unsupervised learning algorithm for the separation of sound sources in one-channel music signals is presented. The algorithm is based on factorizing the magnitude spectrogram of an input signal into a sum of components, each of which has a fixed magnitude spectrum and a time-varying gain. Each sound source, in turn, is modeled as a sum of one or more components. The parameters of the components are estimated by minimizing the reconstruction error between the input spectrogram and the model, while restricting the component spectrograms to be nonnegative and favoring components whose gains are slowly varying and sparse. Temporal continuity is favored by using a cost term which is the sum of squared differences between the gains in adjacent frames, and sparseness is favored by penalizing nonzero gains. The proposed iterative estimation algorithm is initialized with random values, and the gains and the spectra are then alternatively updated using multiplicative update rules until the values converge. Simulation experiments were carried out using generated mixtures of pitched musical instrument samples and drum sounds. The performance of the proposed method was compared with independent subspace analysis and basic nonnegative matrix factorization, which are based on the same linear model. According to these simulations, the proposed method enables a better separation quality than the previous algorithms. Especially, the temporal continuity criterion improved the detection of pitched musical sounds. The sparseness criterion did not produce significant improvements},

Our work is motivated by the fact that standard-rank reduction techniques, such as QR and singular value decomposition, produce low-rank bases which do not respect the structure (i.e., non-negativity for images) of the original data. We observe that NMFs have two very desirable properties for secure image hashing applications: 1) The additivity property resulting from the non-negativity constraints results in bases that capture local components of the image, thereby significantly reducing misclassification and 2) the effect of geometric attacks on images in the spatial domain manifests (approximately) as independent identically distributed noise on NMF vectors, allowing the design of detectors that are both computationally simple and, at the same time, optimal in the sense of minimizing error probabilities. Receiver operating characteristics analysis over a large image database reveals that the proposed algorithms significantly outperform existing approaches for image hashing.},

	abstract = {We consider two algorithm for on-line prediction based on a linear model. The algorithms are the well-known Gradient Descent (GD) algorithm and a new algorithm, which we call EG(+/-). They both maintain a weight vector using simple updates. For the GD algorithm, the update is based on subtracting the gradient of the squared error made on a prediction. The EG(+/-) algorithm uses the components of the gradient in the exponents of factors that are used in updating the weight vector multiplicatively. We present worst-case loss bounds for EG(+/-) and compare them to previously known bounds for the GD algorithm. The bounds suggest that the losses of the algorithms are in general incomparable, but EG(+/-) has a much smaller loss if only a few components of the input are relevant for the predictions. We have performed experiments, which show that our worst-case upper bounds are quite tight already on simple artificial data.},

The basis of the simulator stems from fieldwork and recordings carried out in London and Manchester. Through the use of an enhanced version of soundwalking, respondents are led on a walk around an urban space focusing on the soundscape, whilst answering questions in a semi-structured interview. The data collected is then used to inform the ecological validity of the simulator. The laboratory based tests use simulations based on spaces recorded in a series of urban locations, as well as an ‘idealised’ soundscape simulation, featuring data from all recorded locations. The sound sources used are based on user highlighted selections from all locations, based on preferences extracted from soundwalk field data. Preliminary results show the simulator is effective in obtaining numerical data based on subjective choices as well as, effective qualitative data which provides an insight into the reasoning behind the respondents choices.

The two resulting median ﬁltered spectrograms are then used to generate masks which are then applied to the original spectrogram to separate the harmonic and percussive parts of the signal.

Lorsque ce dernier n'existe pas pour une configuration nombres de blocs/nombre de traitements/nombre de traitements par bloc donnée, l'expérimentateur peut préférer se ramener à un B.I.E. dont la configuration est « proche » de celle étudiée, pour bénéficier des propriétés statistiques remarquables de tels plans. Ce faisant, il renonce en général à des données potentiellement disponibles. À l'inverse, l'expérimentateur peut envisager de construire le plan en respectant strictement la configuration initiale afin de prendre en compte la totalité de ces données, quitte à dégrader les propriétés d'équilibre du plan. Ces deux approches sont d'abord comparées à partir de deux exemples où le plan à construire peut être obtenu de façon simple en adaptant un plan en B.I.E.; les exemples proposés montrent qu'il est préférable, en terme d'efficacité, de conserver la configuration initiale, plutôt que de se ramener à un B.I.E. Pour des configurations plus complexes, les plans peuvent être construits avec profit à partir d'un algorithme de construction de plans optimaux. Les simulations présentées pour un grand nombre de configurations montrent qu'à défaut de présenter systématiquement les équilibres remarquables d'un B.I.E., les plans optimaux ainsi obtenus possèdent une efficacité comparable à ces plans de référence.},

This task is traditionally studied using questionnaires, surveys or categorization tasks followed by a lexical analysis. In contrast, we propose a new experimental approach to tackle this aim. In this approach, the subject is asked to manipulate sound events and textures within a dedicated computer environment in order to recreate two complex urban soundscapes, one ideal and the other not ideal. Subjects have access to a sound data set which has been designed and structured based upon perceptual considerations, and may alter the physical parameters of the selected sound samples. In order to achieve this, we use an audio-digital environment and a web audio interface for sound mining developed for the purpose of this study. The latter allows subjects to explore a sound database without resorting to text. By focusing on the auditory modality during the experimental process, this new paradigm potentially allows the subject to be better put in context and provides a more detailed description of the actual mental representations. In the light of the results presented in this paper, it seems that it also reduces the potential bias of only using verbalization during the experiment.},

	url = {https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00636943},
	abstract = {Intrinsic variability due to micrometeorological effects and/or ground effects, measurement uncertainty and model uncertainty are the main sources of spreading of the parameters influencing outdoor sound propagation. Thus spreading associated to outdoor SPL is a complex combination of deterministic, stochastic and epistemic uncertainties, and can be quantified thanks to a probabilistic process. This statistical process is presented in this paper and is called Calibration Under Uncertainty (CUU). Quantitative uncertainty assessment involves a pre-existing physical system to be studied, input data which can be measured or derived from measurements, and a sufficient amount of available (experimental and/or numerical) data with an eventual human expertise. CUU couples information from experimental and modelled data taking into account their own uncertainties (measurements errors, lack of knowledge on physical behavior, etc.)under specific assumptions. Quantify the global uncertainty on SPL, rank or apportion the contributions of influent parameters to a given output quantity of interest, compare experimental and effective parameters, and more generally understand the whole input-output structure are the main tasks of such a statistical method. CUU process has been applied to more or less complex cases using a large experimental set of data (Lannemezan 2005 (F)). An application to near ground sound propagation has been first led to understand the relative influence of ground parameters. A more complex case considering large distances and including micrometeorological effects has also been fulfilled with promising results which are presented in this paper.},
