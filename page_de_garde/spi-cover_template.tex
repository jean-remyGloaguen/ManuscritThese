%% DISCLAIMER
%
% This template aims at reproducing the look of SPI doctorate school's Microsoft Word template, as it is today (see date above).
% There are minute and purposeful discrepancies, which I consider to be improvements.
% I will not tell where.
%
% To use this template, follow these steps
% 1_ Copy its preamble into yours (except for document class, obviously)
% 2_ Copy the logo files into your document's folder.
% 3_ Copy the content between "FRONT COVER" and "END OF FRONT COVER" at the beginning of your document
% 4_ Copy the content between "BACK COVER" and "END OF BACK COVER" at the end of your document
% 5_ Find all the comments labelled "TODO" and follow their instructions (if relevant).
% Alternatively to steps 3 and 4, you may put the contents in two files front-cover.tex and back-cover.tex, then load them with \input.
%
% Notice: This document has been successfully compiled with pdflatex and TexLive 2016.
% I cannot guarantee that this code will work with your document.
% Furthermore, it will have to be updated as SPI changes its cover.
% I strove to make it easy to understand and modify with my comments.
% Any feedback or improvement is welcome.
% See below for some ideas.
%
% Ideas for improvement:
% _ Change language locally with babel for English abstract.
% _ Several spacing macros have to be adjusted manually (see below). It would be nice to have the corresponding spaces automatically adjusted.
% _ Two other packages (that I know of) can be used to set background pictures: background and wallpaper. Are they more suited than eso-pic here?

%% END OF DISCLAIMER

\documentclass[10pt]{article}

% Standard encoding and language packages.
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage[francais]{babel}
% TODO: replace the above packages with your own encoding settings.
% If you have none, you may want to consider using these.

% Required for cover
\usepackage[a4paper]{geometry} % to change margins on cover pages
\geometry{outer=2cm,inner=3cm,top=3cm}
\usepackage[scaled]{helvet} % font used on cover (Helvetica)
\usepackage{eso-pic} % to set background picture
\usepackage{multicol} % for back cover (abstracts)
\usepackage{graphicx} % to include logos
\usepackage{tikz} % to compose background picture

% Used for template demonstration only
\usepackage{lipsum} % to generate random text with \lipsum.
%TODO: You can remove this package if you use no \lipsum command.

% Colors (extracted from SPI's template)

% Cover environment, to keep changes local
\newenvironment{cover}{%
  \fontfamily{phv}\selectfont % Select Helvetica font
  \pagestyle{empty} % No page number
}{%
  % Do not count this page (useless on back cover, obviously)
  \addtocounter{page}{-1}
  % Go to next odd page (i.e. recto, or right page)
  \cleardoublepage
  % This last command is compulsory even for back cover;
  % without it, the page is not completed and some page-wide
  % commands fail to apply.
