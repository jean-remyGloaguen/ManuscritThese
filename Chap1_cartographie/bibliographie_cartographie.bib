	abstract = {Le précédent guide de prévision de l'émission du bruit émis par le trafic routier remonte à 1980. Le parc automobile, les revêtements routiers, les méthodes d'évaluation des émissions sonores ont évolué. Il devenait donc indispensable de produire un nouveau guide de calcul des émissions. C'est l'objet de ce document.

Le calcul des niveaux sonores ainsi obtenu est nécessaire pour ensuite prévoir les niveaux sonores à grande distance en tenant compte des effets de sol et de météorologie sur la propagation. C'est l'objet d'un autre guide ayant pour titre "Prévision du bruit routier - NMPB 2008- Méthode de calcul de propagation du bruit incluant les effets météorologiques".

Après avoir rappelé quelques définitions spécifiques à l'acoustique (définition des grandeurs physiques, de grandeurs caractéristiques du trafic, présentation des hypothèses de travail …), le guide étudie les deux composantes du bruit émis. L'émission est en effet décomposée en deux composantes : une composante due au bruit dit "de roulement", due au contact pneumatique-chaussée, et une comosante "moteur".

Le guide innove en prenant compte la catégorie du revêtement et son âge dans le calcul du bruit de "roulement".

La première partie du guide décrit la méthode (démarches, formules).
La deuxième partie présente les enjeux associés, les fondements des formules ou des valeurs utilisées, leurs limites, ainsi qu'une comparaison entre les deux guides (celui de 1980 et celui de 2008).},

Après avoir rappelé son domaine d'application, le document présente la méthodologie suivie : il s'agit de calculer les différents termes à l'origine de l'atténuation de l'onde sonore (divergence géométrique, absorption atmosphérique, effet de sol, diffraction), dans les conditions favorables à sa propagation (effet du vent ou d'inversion de température favorisant la propagation des ondes sonores vers les habitations) ou neutre (on parle alors de condtions homogènes).

Le début de l'ouvrage rappelle la manière de décrire la source, en faisant référence au nouveau guide d'émission du bruit 2008 ("Prévision du bruit routier " Document 1 " Calcul des émissions sonores dues au trafic routier"). Il explique ensuite la manière de prendre en compte les effets de la micrométéorologie dans la prévision du bruit à long terme.
Le chapitre suivant décrit les différents types de propagation, avant d'aborder la méthodologie de calcul des rayons, en tenant compte des effets de la diffraction s'il y a lieu.

Dans les annexes figurent les occurrences météo sur 2 et 3 périodes (2 périodes pour la législation française, 3 périodes pour l'application de la directive Européenne 2002/49/CE) pour 41 villes réparties sur le territoire français. Ces occurrences météorologiques sont utilisées pour calculer le niveau sonore de long terme dans les 18 directions autour du point de mesure considéré.
Les annexes rappellent aussi les relations existant entre la météorologie et la propagation du son, avant de préciser les différentes échelles de temps à envisager pour réaliser une analyse météorologique d'une situation acoustique.
Les annexes se terminent par une comparaison entre la méthode de propagation du bruit de 1996, avec celle de 2008, avant de proposer des exemples didactiques d'application de cette nouvelle méthode.},

	abstract = {The two last decades have seen the growth of a large body of scientific and technical literature regarding the effects of anthropogenic noise on terrestrial wildlife and their mitigation. These effects range from behavioral modifications like signalling louder, increasing the signalling rate or redundancy, signalling at a higher pitch, signalling outside noisy periods, but also alterations of intraspecific or interspecific interactions. Moreover it is now proven that man-made noise may lead to reduced reproductive success, reduced species richness or reduced density. The careful design of experiments helps avoid methodological biases some more ancient studies in this field may suffer of. This paper reviews the published literature from an engineering perspective. The focus is put on recommendations for impact assessment and mitigation. The analysis carried out emphasizes that more attention paid to anthropogenic noise emission aspects, especially road surfaces, and propagation issues, in particular micro-meteorology and the range of validity of the prediction methods used, would significantly improve the guidance available.},

The necessary wavefront direction is determined through the calculation of the averaged intensity vector direction. A good agreement is found between simulations of both the transmission line matrix and parabolic equation methods.

The method consists of two simultaneous on-site procedures in various urban situations in two French cities (main thorough fares, pedestrian precincts, playgrounds and market squares). While passers-by were required to express their opinion about soundscapes through questionnaires, we recorded samples of ambient sound environments and calculated acoustic parameters. The cross analysis between survey data and acoustic parameters indicated the sound level is appropriate to the description of main thorough fares, but for similar sound level locations (square, market, or playground) two further perceptive factors were remind. The perceptual spatial dimension was correlated with acoustic indicators as background noise or standard deviation of short LAeq, whereas the temporal dimension revealed differences in the perceptual attitudes of the survey respondents. The results obtained consequently identified the limitation of matching a unique acoustic descriptor with two cognitive representations (a global point of view versus a discrete listening) of the same acoustic phenomenon.},

	abstract = {Since the introduction of the Environmental Noise Directive, strategic noise mapping has been used as a tool for noise policy in many European countries. Although these strategic noise maps have their merits, they also have some shortcomings: accuracy in predicted noise levels in shielded or quiet areas is not very high, the maps fail to capture sounds that are less easy to predict, and above all the dynamics of the sound environment are not included. However, these dynamics might be important to evaluate sleep disturbance and noise annoyance. In this paper, a model to dynamically (every 15min) update a noise map based on measurements is proposed. This model relies on reasonable good source and propagation models and a not-very-dense measurement network. The least mean squares method (LMS) is used for tuning model parameters. To avoid an under-determined system, the number of degrees of freedom is reduced by grouping the sources and propagation paths into different categories. Source strengths and propagation path attenuations in the same category are corrected by offsetting the same small values from their base levels. The map-based interpolation is performed jointly on LAeq,L10 and L90, and takes into account 1/3-octave band spectra. The efficiency of the proposed method was validated in a case study in the Katendrecht district of Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The results showed that more than 75\% of the LAeq predictions are closer to the measurement than the ab initio calculations based on traffic data. Values for L10 and L90 are closer to measurements for 55\% and 90\% of the observations, respectively.},

	abstract = {Noise caused by industry and infrastructure is a major source of dissatisfaction with the environment in residential areas. In order to assess and monitor the influence of noise, policies on noise control have been developed in most European countries. Noise effect studies are carried out to support these policies. The result of different studies can only be combined or compared if the same indicators for noise exposure and the same assessment methods are used. It is therefore important to develop standardised methods for noise mapping. This is recognised by the DG Environment of the European Commission, who is preparing a Directive on Environmental Noise. This article illustrates and underlines the essence of standardised noise mapping tools. It also describes considerations for the development of these tools and focuses on: accuracy; cost-benefit criteria for noise measures; and presentation of uncertainties in results.

Geographical Information Systems (GIS) play an important role in noise mapping. An appropriate use of GIS in mapping noise effects makes it possible to optimise quality and efficiency of noise effect studies. Standardisation will benefit from the possibility of automating the noise mapping process in GIS. Furthermore, GIS can play an important role in estimating and exposing uncertainties.},

calculated for Lden and Lnight using the Harmonoise prediction method as recommended
by the European Union. Emphasis was placed on integrating noise data with a Geographic Information System (GIS). The results demonstrate that using a GIS to integrate noise data with other available spatial data can enhance the accuracy and visualisation of noise maps. In this regard, 3D noise animation was undertaken with a view to increasing public awareness in relation to environmental road transport noise. The results suggest that GIS based noise mapping has the potential to be more effective at
informing environmental policy decision-making, particularly in terms of the actions to be taken as a result of excessively high environmental noise levels. The research also
demonstrates that noise maps are visually sensitive to different methods of data
interpolation. This is something which has not been explored to any great extent in

	abstract = {This paper reports on research conducted to determine estimates of the extent of environmental noise exposure from road transport on residents and workers in central Dublin, Ireland. The Harmonoise calculation method is used to calculate noise values for the study area while a Geographical Information System (GIS) is utilised as a platform upon which levels of noise exposure are estimated. Residential exposure is determined for L(den) and L(night) while worker exposure is determined for L(den). In order to analyse the potential of traffic management as a noise abatement measure, traffic was redirected from the main residential areas to alternative road links and the revised exposure levels were determined. The results show that the extent of noise exposure in Dublin is considerable, and in relative terms, it is worse for the night-time period. In addition, the results suggest also that traffic management measures have the potential to lead to significant reductions in the level of noise exposure provided that careful consideration is given to the impact of traffic flows on residential populations.},

	abstract = {The first phase of noise mapping and action planning in Ireland, in accordance with EU Directive 2002/49/EC, is now complete. In total this included one agglomeration, one airport and approximately 600 km of major roads outside the agglomeration. These noise maps describe the level of noise exposure of approximately 1.25 million people. The first phase of noise mapping was dealt with by five noise mapping bodies while 26 action planning authorities were involved in the development of the associated action plans. The second phase of noise mapping, due to be completed in 2012, sees a reduction in the defined thresholds describing the required agglomerations, roads and railways that have to be mapped. This will have a significant impact on the extent of mapping required. In Ireland this will result in an increased number of local authorities being required to develop strategic noise maps for their area along with the further development of associated action plans. It is appropriate at this point to review the work process and results from the first phase of noise mapping in Ireland in order to establish areas that could be improved, throughout the noise mapping project. In this paper a review of the implementation procedures focussing on (dominant) road traffic noise is presented. It is identified that more standardisation is needed and this could be achieved by the establishment of a national expert steering group.},

The performance of the proposed system is superior to that of centralized countersniper systems in such challenging environment as dense urban terrain. In this paper, in addition to the overall system architecture, the acoustic signal detection, the most important middleware services and the unique sensor fusion algorithm are also presented. The system performance is analyzed using real measurement data obtained at a US Army MOUT (Military Operations in Urban Terrain) facility.},

However, in some situations, the visual information is not sufficient or sufficiently reliable, whereas the use of microphones and audio event detectors can significantly improve the overall reliability of surveillance systems. In this paper, we propose a novel method for detecting road accidents by analyzing audio streams to identify hazardous situations such as tire skidding and car crashes. Our method is based on a two-layer representation of an audio stream: at a low level, the system extracts a set of features that is able to capture the discriminant properties of the events of interest, and at a high level, a representation based on a bag-of-words approach is then exploited in order to detect both short and sustained events. The deployment architecture for using the system in real environments is discussed, together with an experimental analysis carried out on a data set made publicly available for benchmarking purposes. The obtained results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

The feasibility of this approach will be proved implementing the system in two pilot areas with different territorial and environmental characteristics: an agglomeration and a major road. The first pilot area will be located in Milan, in a significant portion of the town, while the second one will be situated along the motorway A90 surrounding the city of Rome. The two pilot areas show peculiar needs and characteristics, such as the presence of multiple noise sources, roads junctions, traffic and weather conditions, that require a different system’s implementation approach. In this paper the main issues related to the design of the system configuration in the pilot area of Rome are described.},

	abstract = {The soundscape--a term coined by the author--is our sonic environment, the ever-present array of noises with which we all live. Beginning with the primordial sounds of nature, we have experienced an ever-increasing complexity of our sonic surroundings. As civilization develops, new noises rise up around us: from the creaking wheel, the clang of the blacksmith’s hammer, and the distant chugging of steam trains to the “sound imperialism” of airports, city streets, and factories. The author contends that we now suffer from an overabundance of acoustic information and a proportionate diminishing of our ability to hear the nuances and subtleties of sound. Our task, he maintains, is to listen, analyze, and make distinctions.  As a society we have become more aware of the toxic wastes that can enter our bodies through the air we breathe and the water we drink. In fact, the pollution of our sonic environment is no less real. Schafer emphasizes the importance of discerning the sounds that enrich and feed us and using them to create healthier environments. To this end, he explains how to classify sounds, appreciating their beauty or ugliness, and provides exercises and “soundwalks” to help us become more discriminating and sensitive to the sounds around us. This book is a pioneering exploration of our acoustic environment, past and present, and an attempt to imagine what it might become in the future.},

	abstract = {Mobile sensors can be interesting in the context of monitoring of noise levels and airborne pollutant concentrations, to obtain measurements over a large zone with one single sensor, and to increase the spatial accuracy of predictions, while avoiding some expensive modelling. Mobile sensors can be combined to classical fixed station, to improve the accuracy and the reliability of predictions. The purpose of this paper is to explore how mobile measurements should be processed to obtain reliable estimations in spite of the strong variability of the data collected. Mobile measurements have been collected on a bicycle equipped with a global positioning system (GPS), in an area of Gent (Belgium). The 1s-sound pressure levels and 1s-black carbon concentrations evolutions were measured. In addition, 5 continuous monitoring fixed stations were placed at building facades. Different processing methods are compared, based on different temporal and spatial weighting aggregations. The possibility to take profit of the fixed stations to refine estimations is tested, according to the noise levels collected at fixed stations and the distance between mobile and fixed sensors. Finally, the operational conditions required to obtain reliable estimations based on mobile measures are discussed.},

	abstract = {One of the main priorities of smart cities is improving the quality of life of their inhabitants. Traffic noise is one of the pollutant sources that causes a negative impact on the quality of life of citizens, which is gaining attention among authorities. The European Commission has promoted the Environmental Noise Directive 2002/49/EC (END) to inform citizens and to prevent the harmful effects of noise exposure. The measure of acoustic levels using noise maps is a strategic issue in the END action plan. Noise maps are typically calculated by computing the average noise during one year and updated every five years. Hence, the implementation of dynamic noise mapping systems could lead to short-term plan actions, besides helping to better understand the evolution of noise levels along time. Recently, some projects have started the monitoring of noise levels in urban areas by means of acoustic sensor networks settled in strategic locations across the city, while others have taken advantage of collaborative citizen sensing mobile applications. In this paper, we describe the design of an acoustic low-cost sensor network installed on public buses to measure the traffic noise in the city in real time. Moreover, the challenges that a ubiquitous bus acoustic measurement system entails are enumerated and discussed. Specifically, the analysis takes into account the feature extraction of the audio signal, the identification and separation of the road traffic noise from urban traffic noise, the hardware platform to measure and process the acoustic signal, the connectivity between the several nodes of the acoustic sensor network to store the data and, finally, the noise maps’ generation process. The implementation and evaluation of the proposal in a real-life scenario is left for future work.},
